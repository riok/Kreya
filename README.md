- Server reflection (gRPC)
- Unary, client-streaming, server-streaming and duplex requests (gRPC)
- File based storage for easy git-syncing (or any other syncing software)
- Authentication configurations - declare once, use everywhere
- Environments
- Powerful templating language
- Project or directory settings (ex. define the endpoint only once for all requests)
- Scripting and tests
- And more!
